On a year-over-year measurement, January’s sales were 2.3% below the 6.65 million recorded in January 2021.\n\"Buyers were likely anticipating further rate increases and locking-in at the low rates, and investors added to overall demand with all-cash offers,\" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. \"Consequently, housing prices continue to move solidly higher.\"\nNAR reported the median existing-home price for all housing types in January was $350,300, up 15.4% from the $303,600 price level achieved one year ago. January marked the 119th consecutive month of year-over-year increases, the longest-running streak on record.\nWhile prices rose, total housing inventory continued to decline. By the end of January, 860,000 units were listed, down 2.3% from December and down 16.5% from the 1.03 million level of one year earlier.

Short-term rates tend to be more influenced by central banks and monetary policy to stimulate the economy, support employment and maintain price stability.
