rates have spiked as a result of rising inflation and stronger than expected consumer spending, according to new data released by Freddie Mac (OTCQB: FMCC).\nWhile mortgage rates were on the rise, housing starts were in decline, based on the latest federal data.\nWhat Happened: Freddie Mac reported the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.92% for the week ending Feb. 17, up from last week’s average of 3.69%; last year at this time, it averaged 2.81%. Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, observed this upswing brought the mortgage’s rate to its highest level since May 2019.\n“As rates and house prices rise, affordability has become a substantial hurdle for potential homebuyers, especially as inflation threatens to place a strain on consumer budgets,” Khater said.\nThe 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.15%, up from last week when it averaged 2.93%. The five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage averaged 2.98%, up from last week when it averaged 2.8%.\nWhile rates were taking off, mortgage applications dropped 5.4% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) seasonally adjusted index.\n\"Mortgage rates increased across the board last week following the recent rise in Treasury yields, which have moved higher due to unrelenting inflationary pressures and increased market ...","keywords":["News","Penny Stocks","Small Cap","Top Stories","Real Estate"]},{"id":"CWukoJQOC_OOLxhad4ye1qFF9yZbeR6qlVux3lEIOOU","publisher":{"name":"MarketWatch","homepage_url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/marketwatch.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/marketwatch.ico"},"title":"Stock market faces the most 'massive misallocation' of 'capital in the history of mankind,' says ARK's Cathie Wood","author":"MarketWatch","published_utc":"2022-02-17T18:51:00Z","article_url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-market-faces-the-most-massive-misallocation-of-capital-in-the-history-of-mankind-says-arks-cathie-wood-11645123885","tickers":["ARKK","COMP","RBLX","TDOC","ZM","FB","AAPL","AMZN","NFLX","GOOG","GOOGL","SARK"],"amp_url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/stock-market-faces-the-most-massive-misallocation-of-capital-in-the-history-of-mankind-says-arks-cathie-wood-11645123885","image_url":"https://images.mktw.net/im-488114/social","description":"Cathie Wood, the star fund manager and chief executive of ARK Invest, took to CNBC on Thursday to defend ARK's woeful performance over the past year."},{"id":"devWHB348A5P2bOVfXUR4XaOn6FzubzMJ0dg_kIpO_Q","publisher":{"name":"Quartz","homepage_url":"https://qz.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/quartz.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/quartz.ico"},"title":"Microsoft is adding user safety measures to its AltspaceVR platform","author":"Adario Strange","published_utc":"2022-02-17T18:43:57Z","article_url":"https://qz.com/2129753/microsoft-boosts-the-safety-protocols-for-its-social-vr-platform/","tickers":["FB","MSFT"],"amp_url":"https://qz.com/2129753/microsoft-boosts-the-safety-protocols-for-its-social-vr-platform/amp/","image_url":"https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2021-06-08T121015Z_701455277_RC22VN9KN4MZ_RTRMADP_3_HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-DENMARK-VACCINES-e1645111325736.jpg?quality=75\u0026strip=all\u0026w=1200\u0026h=630\u0026crop=1","description":"Microsoft is following the lead of Meta by enhancing the safety protocols on its popular social VR platform AltspaceVR","keywords":["Immersive internet","alex kipman","AltspaceVR","Business","Entertainment","facebook","immersive internet","meta","metaverse","Microsoft","virtual reality","VR"]},{"id":"qVE_3w_nOks-hU_-PaoOawJp0zlnQyqxLFjaTJp72Jo","publisher":{"name":"Zacks Investment Research","homepage_url":"https://www.zacks.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/zacks.png","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/zacks.ico"},"title":"Top Analyst Reports for Adobe, Altria Group \u0026 Marriott International","author":"Mark Vickery","published_utc":"2022-02-17T18:40:00Z","article_url":"https://www.zacks.com/research-daily/1869151/top-analyst-reports-for-adobe-altria-group-marriott-international","tickers":["MAR","EPD","MO","ADBE","IQV"],"image_url":"https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/main/41/953.jpg","description":"Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Adobe Inc.
