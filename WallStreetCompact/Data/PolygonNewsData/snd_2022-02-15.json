In 2019, the company unveiled its Inspirato Pass, which is billed as the first luxury travel subscription inclusive of nightly rates, taxes, and fees.\nInspirato, which has an 800-person workforce, secured more than $100 million in net proceeds from its SPAC merger, and the combined company began trading with an initial valuation of approximately $1.1 billion.\nBenzinga spoke with co-founder and CEO Brent Handler on Inspirato’s journey from concept to stock exchange.\n\nBrett Handler\nQ: What inspired your company’s journey from being privately owned to being publicly traded? \nBrent Handler: I had started a company called Exclusive Resorts in 2002 and left at the end of 2009. It was another kind of luxury vacation company and was sold to Steve Case. 2010 was a year when my brother and I came up with the concept for Inspirato. We had a one-year non-compete clause, and then we sold our first membership on Jan. 1 2011.\nWe introduced the Inspirato Pass in 2019, right before the pandemic, and we had this really big growth engine. We wanted to grow in a way that's just too difficult as a private company.\nWe went through a formal fundraising process, almost exactly a year ago, and were thinking of either a traditional IPO, working with a SPAC or a larger late-stage private round.

After he was ousted from the company in 1985, he returned to the company in late 1996 through the Next acquisition, rising like a phoenix from the ashes, gaining prominence and playing a significant role in the fortunes of the company than ever before. Thus, the decision to rehire Jobs seems to be the wisest the company has ever made.\n \nOuster And The Home Coming\nJob's exit from Apple in 1985 was the result of the clash between himself and the then CEO John Sculley, whom Jobs hired from PepsiCo, Inc.
