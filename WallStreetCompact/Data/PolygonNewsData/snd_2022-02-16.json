(NASDAQ: RUSHA \u0026 RUSHB), which operates the largest network of commercial vehicle dealerships in North America, today announced that for the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company achieved revenues of $5.1 billion and record-high net income of $241.4 million, or $4.17 per diluted share, compared with revenues of $4.7 billion and net income of $114.9 million, or $2.04 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.19 per share of Class A and Class B Common Stock, to be paid on March 15, 2022, to all shareholders of record as of February 28, 2022.“Given the supply chain challenges our industry faced this past year, we are pleased with our strong financial results in 2021. We are also happy to announce that our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share. This, combined with the $100 million share repurchase authorization approved in the fourth quarter of 2021, reflects on our ability to return value to our shareholders while continuing to grow our network and invest in the future of our business,” said W.M. “Rusty” Rush, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Rush Enterprises, Inc. “During 2021, the general economy was strong, and increased consumer spending led to solid freight rates and healthy demand for new commercial vehicles. However, the industry was also negatively impacted by supply chain issues that affected the ability of the manufacturers we represent to obtain component parts for both new commercial vehicle production and aftermarket support. As a result, such manufacturers’ commercial vehicle production capabilities were limited,” Rush explained. “Our large inventory of parts and our ability to obtain parts from multiple sources allowed us to mitigate the negative impact of aftermarket component supply chain constraints. So, although component parts supply chain issues did limit our aftermarket products and services growth last year, we are still very pleased with our aftermarket revenues, which increased by 12.1%,” he stated. “Increased demand for parts sales and service repairs from the market segments we support, particularly our large fleet customers, along with our strategic initiatives, contributed to our aftermarket growth last year. Going forward into 2022, our teams remain focused on managing expenses. Our ability to successfully manage expenses during 2021 directly contributed to us more than doubling our annual earnings per share compared to 2020,” said Rush. “In December 2021, we completed the largest acquisition in our history, acquiring 17 dealerships in five states from The Summit Truck Group, all of which are now operating as Rush Truck Centers. By implementing our business strategies at these new locations and remaining focused on expense management at our other locations, we believe we can increase our revenue growth and enhance profitability moving forward,” Rush said. “Looking ahead, supply constraints will likely continue to limit production of new commercial vehicles through at least the middle of 2022. However, we expect demand for new commercial vehicles to remain strong through the year. Considering our current backlog and our recent acquisitions, we believe our heavy-duty truck sales will outperform the market in 2022,” said Rush. “In addition, we believe that our continued focus on growing our parts sales market share, adding service technicians to our workforce and continuing to successfully manage expenses will contribute to increased aftermarket revenues and overall profitability in 2022,” he added.","keywords":["Calendar of Events","Dividend Reports and Estimates","Earnings Releases and Operating Results"]},{"id":"bEDybm_9wA29LvnoNUPwe_Sv0S7NDZbtBgg3MDj1uSk","publisher":{"name":"GlobeNewswire Inc.","homepage_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/globenewswire.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/globenewswire.ico"},"title":"Brady Corporation declares regular dividend to shareholders","author":"Brady Corporation","published_utc":"2022-02-16T22:10:00Z","article_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/02/16/2386682/0/en/Brady-Corporation-declares-regular-dividend-to-shareholders.html","tickers":["BRC"],"amp_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/02/16/2386682/0/en/Brady-Corporation-declares-regular-dividend-to-shareholders.html","image_url":"https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/65ed6a84-b09e-4550-ab77-280b19f83a33?size=1","description":"MILWAUKEE, Feb.  16, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On February 15, 2022, Brady Corporation’s (NYSE: BRC) Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend to shareholders of the company's Class A Common Stock of $0.225 per share, payable on April 29, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 8, 2022.","keywords":["Dividend Reports and Estimates"]},{"id":"1OHSNyviO6nvlrcdsQz4F_DG1ckNAKtgY_tYsIkZytE","publisher":{"name":"GlobeNewswire Inc.","homepage_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/globenewswire.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/globenewswire.ico"},"title":"AutoZone to Release Second Quarter Earnings March 1, 2022","author":"AutoZone, Inc.","published_utc":"2022-02-16T22:09:00Z","article_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/02/16/2386681/3935/en/AutoZone-to-Release-Second-Quarter-Earnings-March-1-2022.html","tickers":["AZO"],"amp_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/02/16/2386681/3935/en/AutoZone-to-Release-Second-Quarter-Earnings-March-1-2022.html","image_url":"https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/d4a5a30f-f3af-4d87-af4c-fc7a2d67ebf6?size=1","description":"MEMPHIS, Tenn., Feb.  16, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoZone, Inc.

In addition, the valuation multiple difference, which we refer to as the valuation gap, is shown by the black line.\n\nThe recent rally has produced a visible uptick in valuation multiples. The multiple for the large companies has increased from 8.49x at the end of January to 10.0x on February 11, 2022. Similarly, the smaller company multiple has increased from 4.3x to 5.0x over the same period.\n\n\nHowever, the graph clarifies that investors have not entirely bought into the idea that banking reform is imminent. Multiples have only retraced their way back to year-end levels and remain below any month-end levels from 2021.\n\n\nThe historical valuation gap is fascinating.

Seven years later, Boeing teamed with U.S. Commander George Conrad Westervelt to create the B\u0026W Seaplane under the corporate banner of Aero Products Co.\nToday, Boeing develops, manufactures and services commercial airplanes, defense products and space systems for customers in more than 150 countries. The company, which has been publicly traded since 1962, has four key segments: commercial airplanes, defense-space-security, global services and Boeing Capital.\n\nAmong its recent corporate developments, the Chicago-headquartered Boeing announced it generated more than $2 billion in online orders last year, a company record, with nearly 70,000 parts products sold to commercial and government customers.\nLast month, it launched the new 777-8 Freighter and expanded its 777X and freighter families of jetliners with an order for up to 50 aircraft from Qatar Airways. Over the past three months, Boeing has announced orders from carriers including United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS), DHL Express, Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT) Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAWW), China Airlines, Singapore Airlines ADR (OTC: SINGY), Emirates, Saudia, Air Tanzania and Akasa Air.\nBut the company also shouldered some troublesome news on Feb. 15 when the Federal Aviation Administration announced it would retain the power to approve Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft for flight rather than return that authority to the company, which has not delivered any new Dreamliner aircraft since last May due to production flaws. The FAA added Boeing would regain that authority once 787 deliveries resumed and the aircraft ...","keywords":["Long Ideas","News","Education","Opinion","Top Stories","Trading Ideas","General"]},{"id":"xQI-CMcgod_v_hrYshdqUmBfs3TOPhBFMdFKKMn3Eb0","publisher":{"name":"Zacks Investment Research","homepage_url":"https://www.zacks.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/zacks.png","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/zacks.ico"},"title":"BorgWarner (BWA) Electrification Efforts to Bolster Capabilities","author":"Zacks Equity Research","published_utc":"2022-02-16T15:44:00Z","article_url":"https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1868509/borgwarner-bwa-electrification-efforts-to-bolster-capabilities","tickers":["BWA","TSLA","DORM"],"amp_url":"https://www.zacks.com/amp/stock/news/1868509/borgwarner-bwa-electrification-efforts-to-bolster-capabilities","image_url":"https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/main/79/1382.jpg","description":"With strategic acquisitions and contracts, BorgWarner (BWA) aims to make its mark in the electrification and OEM domain in the near future."},{"id":"5SmBL21ouqsVzLNzAmJr5gt6IAAyd2stqG07gHyM24I","publisher":{"name":"Zacks Investment Research","homepage_url":"https://www.zacks.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/zacks.png","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/zacks.ico"},"title":"Resideo (REZI) Arrow Wire Buyout to Aid ADI Global Distribution","author":"Zacks Equity Research","published_utc":"2022-02-16T15:44:00Z","article_url":"https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1868514/resideo-rezi-arrow-wire-buyout-to-aid-adi-global-distribution","tickers":["NWL","VRRM","REZI","KNBE"],"amp_url":"https://www.zacks.com/amp/stock/news/1868514/resideo-rezi-arrow-wire-buyout-to-aid-adi-global-distribution","image_url":"https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/default_article_images/default130.jpg","description":"Resideo's (REZI) Arrow Wire buyout will boost its data communications offerings, distribution network and market presence.

This content is for informational purposes only and not intended to be investing advice.\n(Wednesday Market Open) Tuesday’s relief rally is struggling to find legs on Wednesday morning despite a couple of positive earnings announcements and a positive retail sales report. The commodity market is finding new stars in technology-related metals and materials. Rising commodities and inflation are a boost for inflationary sectors, but consumers are feeling it in their pocketbooks.\nConsumers are also moving away from online shopping. Despite beating on earnings and revenue estimates, Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) was falling 5.57% in premarket trading. The e-commerce and fintech company cautioned investors about revenue headwinds in the first half of 2022 because shoppers are preferring to hit brick and mortar stores versus online as the economy reopens from the pandemic.\nFood producer Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC) is also up in premarket trading by 1.50%. KHC reported better than expected earnings and revenue. The company was able to navigate higher costs and a broken supply chain; it appears to have passed costs onto consumers.\nMany of these costs were reflected in this morning’s retail sales report. Retail sales came in much stronger than expected before the open on Wednesday—growing 3.8% month over month, which was above the estimate of 2%. Core retail sales also grew at a much higher pace, reporting 3.3% month over month growth, which was well above the projected 0.8%. The retail sales report isn’t adjusted for inflation, so it’s difficult to say what growth is driven from demand and how much of the growth reflects rising prices.\nTuesday’s Action\nMoving over to semiconductors, Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ADI) also beat on top and bottom line numbers leading to it trading 2.44% higher in premarket trading. The company also increased its second quarter earnings outlook as well as its dividend.\nAfter yesterday’s close, metaverse pioneer Roblox (NYSE: RBLX) fell more than 16% after reporting underwhelming earnings results despite growing earnings by 83% year over year. User growth was lower than expected, with 49.5 million daily active users instead of the 50.1 million analysts were forecasting.\nViacomCBS (NASDAQ: VIAC) was also down in extended hours trading. VIAC fell 13.89% after reporting lower-than-expected earnings. The company put a lot of resources into its Paramount+ streaming service, which came at a big cost. However, it was able to add 9.4 million subscribers, which was well above the 6.4 million analysts were expecting. Viacom also announced it would change its name to Paramount Global.\nHotel and leisure companies are still dealing with pandemic issues and a changing marketplace. Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) posted better than expected results despite ongoing issues with the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross bookings were up $11.3 billion, which is a 91% increase from a year ago and 32% higher from two years ago. The company also expects to see booking over pre-pandemic levels.
