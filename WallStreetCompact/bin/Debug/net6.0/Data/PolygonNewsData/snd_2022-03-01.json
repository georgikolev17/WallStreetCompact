The Company believes that the market price of the Shares may not, from time to time, fully reflect their value and accordingly the purchase of Shares would be in the best interests of the Company and an attractive use of available funds.","keywords":["Company Announcement"]},{"id":"XTr6CGNEZvz4IhivyZ5yU8zt00lW5IaJjgagXWO2cj0","publisher":{"name":"GlobeNewswire Inc.","homepage_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/globenewswire.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/globenewswire.ico"},"title":"CNH Industrial N.V. files 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F and publishes 2021 EU Annual Report; calling of the Annual General Meeting","author":"CNH Industrial N.V.","published_utc":"2022-03-01T22:30:00Z","article_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/01/2394907/0/en/CNH-Industrial-N-V-files-2021-Annual-Report-on-Form-20-F-and-publishes-2021-EU-Annual-Report-calling-of-the-Annual-General-Meeting.html","tickers":["CNHI","CNHI"],"amp_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/01/2394907/0/en/CNH-Industrial-N-V-files-2021-Annual-Report-on-Form-20-F-and-publishes-2021-EU-Annual-Report-calling-of-the-Annual-General-Meeting.html","image_url":"https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/68cfb7c8-18c3-474b-8163-fcab231a8b31?size=1","description":"London, March 1, 2022","keywords":["Annual report","Annual Meetings \u0026 Shareholder Rights"]},{"id":"TfqTp7Mee6t5yO3cDzT-Oebqspokl6mVaXqP0R2sCdY","publisher":{"name":"GlobeNewswire Inc.","homepage_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/globenewswire.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/globenewswire.ico"},"title":"CNH Industrial N.V. deposita il Bilancio Annuale 2021 su Form 20-F e pubblica la Relazione Finanziaria Europea 2021; convocazione dell’Assemblea degli Azionisti","author":"CNH Industrial N.V.","published_utc":"2022-03-01T22:30:00Z","article_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/01/2394907/0/it/CNH-Industrial-N-V-deposita-il-Bilancio-Annuale-2021-su-Form-20-F-e-pubblica-la-Relazione-Finanziaria-Europea-2021-convocazione-dell-Assemblea-degli-Azionisti.html","tickers":["CNHI","CNHI"],"amp_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/01/2394907/0/it/CNH-Industrial-N-V-deposita-il-Bilancio-Annuale-2021-su-Form-20-F-e-pubblica-la-Relazione-Finanziaria-Europea-2021-convocazione-dell-Assemblea-degli-Azionisti.html","image_url":"https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/68cfb7c8-18c3-474b-8163-fcab231a8b31?size=1","description":"Londra, 1 marzo 2022","keywords":["Annual report","Annual Meetings \u0026 Shareholder Rights"]},{"id":"Hdna6Q9Lx_8KFxhLe2nqLse0U-jpArOvtJtL2FxePPM","publisher":{"name":"Zacks Investment Research","homepage_url":"https://www.zacks.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/zacks.png","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/zacks.ico"},"title":"Union Pacific (UNP) Up 17.6% in a Year: More Room to Rally?","author":"Zacks Equity Research","published_utc":"2022-03-01T22:29:00Z","article_url":"https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1875567/union-pacific-unp-up-176-in-a-year-more-room-to-rally","tickers":["UNP","EXPD","ARCB"],"amp_url":"https://www.zacks.com/amp/stock/news/1875567/union-pacific-unp-up-176-in-a-year-more-room-to-rally","image_url":"https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/main/f3/426.jpg","description":"The improving freight scenario bodes well for Union Pacific (UNP)."},{"id":"i8qpBNa-2WhS_h5lnDGknmeD4EmWPyCcZtfmdEozrio","publisher":{"name":"MarketWatch","homepage_url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/marketwatch.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/marketwatch.ico"},"title":"Credit markets still cautiously open to U.S. companies as Russia-Ukraine war escalates","author":"MarketWatch","published_utc":"2022-03-01T22:26:00Z","article_url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/credit-markets-still-cautiously-open-to-u-s-companies-as-russia-ukraine-war-escalates-11646173595","tickers":["DJIA","COF","BRBR","TWTR"],"amp_url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/credit-markets-still-cautiously-open-to-u-s-companies-as-russia-ukraine-war-escalates-11646173595","image_url":"https://images.mktw.net/im-495849/social","description":"Borrowing conditions for U.S. companies often serve as a gauge for the Federal Reserve as it calibrates monetary policy.

Ethereum, however, may have further room to run in the immediate future, because its relative strength index (RSI) has more room to move higher before flashing a warning sign.\nIt should be noted, however, that events affecting the general markets, negative or positive reactions to earnings prints and news headlines can quickly invalidate patterns and breakouts. As the saying goes, \"the trend is your friend until it isn't\" and any trader in a position should have a clear stop set in place and manage their risk versus reward.\nIn The News: For ordinary Russians, crypto may offer a safe haven from the geopolitical events demolishing their country's official currency. ...","keywords":["Cryptocurrency","Technicals","Markets","Trading Ideas"]},{"id":"W32BwI2eKTYyUwdSN1et33rG3kFxWV2vPmDOBuYqk3o","publisher":{"name":"GlobeNewswire Inc.","homepage_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/globenewswire.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/globenewswire.ico"},"title":"iSIGN Media Announces the Close of its Previously Announced Shares for Debt Transaction of $730,447","author":"iSIGN Media Solutions Inc.","published_utc":"2022-03-01T20:07:00Z","article_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/01/2394749/0/en/iSIGN-Media-Announces-the-Close-of-its-Previously-Announced-Shares-for-Debt-Transaction-of-730-447.html","tickers":["ISD"],"amp_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/01/2394749/0/en/iSIGN-Media-Announces-the-Close-of-its-Previously-Announced-Shares-for-Debt-Transaction-of-730-447.html","image_url":"https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/284052f8-e8cf-408b-817c-0ef908bad49a?size=1","description":"TORONTO, March  01, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iSIGN Media Solutions Inc.

As part of the CIIR, TransUnion maps consumer credit health with its Credit Industry Indicator (CII), which rose 32 points year-on-year (YoY) to 101.6 during the period, driven by ongoing improvements in credit performance, as well as strong demand and supply of credit. While there has been continued momentum as the economy recovers from the pandemic, the CII has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels; in December 2019, it was at 105.7. The CII, which TransUnion launched in July 2021, is a country-specific measure of consumer credit health trends in four categories: demand, supply, consumer behaviour and performance.","keywords":["Market Research Reports"]},{"id":"bbYWjUBaYBAYlyAgH8N5PKthXEhNJ-m2A5sJ77muiP8","publisher":{"name":"The Motley Fool","homepage_url":"https://www.fool.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/themotleyfool.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/themotleyfool.ico"},"title":"Lemonade's Fourth Quarter: Soaring Loss Ratio","author":"newsfeedback@fool.com (Jennifer Saibil)","published_utc":"2022-03-01T11:00:00Z","article_url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/03/01/lemonades-fourth-quarter-soaring-loss-ratio/","tickers":["LMND","ROOT","HIPO","MILE"],"image_url":"https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/667609/a-woman-wearing-a-large-sun-hat-and-drinking-lemonade-outside.jpg","description":"The mostly positive report had two ominous signs.","keywords":["investing"]},{"id":"W9TiYzlCdLWapcwDfMtD55MgyaS_Lk1YkJ4RwMXrb94","publisher":{"name":"GlobeNewswire Inc.","homepage_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/globenewswire.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/globenewswire.ico"},"title":"Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Financial Results and Operational Highlights","author":"Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","published_utc":"2022-03-01T11:00:00Z","article_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/01/2393995/36775/en/Zynerba-Pharmaceuticals-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2021-Financial-Results-and-Operational-Highlights.html","tickers":["ZYNE"],"amp_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/01/2393995/36775/en/Zynerba-Pharmaceuticals-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2021-Financial-Results-and-Operational-Highlights.html","image_url":"https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/8808ec02-5a09-4421-b36b-f47b1f479f29?size=1","description":"– European Commission granted orphan drug designation for Zygel™ in Fragile X syndrome (FXS) –","keywords":["Earnings Releases and Operating Results"]},{"id":"E2nHM4Hvp14h4wR9DvonmyPIIirD0uOdn_gdvspQLG0","publisher":{"name":"GlobeNewswire Inc.","homepage_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/globenewswire.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/globenewswire.ico"},"title":"RadNet Reports Fourth Quarter 2021 Results and Releases 2022 Financial Guidance","author":"RadNet, Inc.","published_utc":"2022-03-01T11:00:00Z","article_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/01/2393987/10985/en/RadNet-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Releases-2022-Financial-Guidance.html","tickers":["RDNT"],"amp_url":"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/01/2393987/10985/en/RadNet-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Releases-2022-Financial-Guidance.html","image_url":"https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/cae5dbb9-862d-4faf-aac0-5653998f4f2c?size=1","description":"LOS ANGELES, March  01, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RadNet, Inc.
