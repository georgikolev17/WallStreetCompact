Here's a look at how the company's cloud business did vis-à-vis the competition. \nAlibaba's Cloud Growth Slows:  Alibaba's December quarter cloud revenues came in at $3.07 billion, or roughly 5% of its total revenues of $38.07 billion. Cloud revenues grew 27% year-over-year, slowing from the 33% rate in the September quarter.\nAlibaba attributed the year-over-year growth to robust demand from financial and telecom industries. That said, the segment continued to be impacted by a loss of contract from a top customer that decided to stop using Alibaba's overseas cloud services for its international business.\nAlthough the company did not ...","keywords":["News","Earnings","Tech"]},{"id":"in_1p1bst-s3v_N_NfeT3EE66e9FT4X87Ns_nWPVUNo","publisher":{"name":"Benzinga","homepage_url":"https://www.benzinga.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/benzinga.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/benzinga.ico"},"title":"Analysis: Are US Sanctions Against Putin Too Weak?

But the president acknowledged his first round of sanctions unveiled Wednesday and his repeated threats to enact financial hardship on Russia have yet to make an impact on President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine.\nHowever, a news report has surfaced that the Biden administration might be taking a proactive approach to dealing with the Putin regime rather than a reactive strategy via a cybersecurity assault that would disrupt the Russian presence in Ukraine.\nSee Also: How The Markets Are Reacting To Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\nWhat Happened: Speaking from the East Room of the White House, Biden expanded the U.S. sanctions to include five Russian banks — Novikom, Otkritie, Sberbank, Sovcom and VTB — that hold a combined $1 billion in assets. Biden also expanded sanctions against 10 Russian nationals, including financial services executives and those with close ties to Putin.\n“Putin is the aggressor,” Biden said. “Putin chose this war, and now he and his country will bear the consequences. Putin will be a pariah on the international stage.”\nThe Biden administration, through the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, also sanctioned 24 Belarusian individuals and entities, citing their participation in Ukraine invasion.\nWhat Didn’t ...","keywords":["News","Government","Global","Top Stories","Markets"]},{"id":"5GEYviGSzZkKdKb-cOh-sO1CdWKGrvzzOPjZpM3CdBY","publisher":{"name":"Benzinga","homepage_url":"https://www.benzinga.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/benzinga.svg","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/benzinga.ico"},"title":"From NFL To Hollywood: Tom Brady To Produce And Star In Paramount Film","author":"Chris Katje","published_utc":"2022-02-24T20:47:20Z","article_url":"https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/22/02/25819525/from-nfl-to-hollywood-tom-brady-to-produce-and-star-in-paramount-film","tickers":["PARA","PARAA"],"amp_url":"https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/25819525","image_url":"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/24990170276_479275b775_c.jpg","description":"Legendary National Football League quarterback Tom Brady announced his retirement after the end of the 2021-2022 season.

fears of rising interest rates, and inflation that have been piquing investors are now starkly overshadowed by a full-blown Russian invasion of Ukraine. \nPresident Joe Biden and U.S allies have imposed sanctions on Russia including the pausing of a key natural gas pipeline between Germany and Russia; financial restrictions on Russian oligarchs and banks; as well as an end to the trading of Russia’s government bonds on exchanges in the U.S. and other allied countries.  \nWhat Happened: President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian forces to invade Ukraine early Thursday morning in a massed assault by land, sea and air signaling the largest attack on one European state since World War II. \nWestern leaders warned that even harsher punitive measures will be unleashed in the event Russia moves further into Ukraine. \nWhy It Matters: Russia is an energy hub for Europe, supplying 40% of Europe’s energy and 35% of the continent's gas. \nOil prices have
