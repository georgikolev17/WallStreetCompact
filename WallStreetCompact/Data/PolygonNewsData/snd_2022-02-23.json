disruptions created by the convoy. This action enabled the nation’s banks and the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center of Canada to monitor transactions and freeze accounts as a means to cut off funding support to the protest movement.\nAccording to The Globe and Mail, the Emergencies Act measures only impacted transactions made following the invocation of the act.

(NASDAQ: DENN) and Shake Shack Inc. (NASDAQ: SHAK).\nThe Case For Denny’s: This company traces its roots back to a coffee shop called Danny's Donuts that opened in 1953 in Lakewood, California. The business grew into a six-store chain within three years when it changed its name to Danny’s Coffee Shops and started operating as a 24-hour business. Danny’s Coffee Shops became Denny’s Coffee Shops in 1959 to avoid confusion with another California chain, Coffee Dan’s. The business renamed itself again in 1961 as Denny’s.\nToday, the Spartanburg, South Carolina-headquartered Denny’s has 1,640 franchised, licensed, and company restaurants across the U.S. (including Puerto Rico and Guam) and is in 11 countries. It has been publicly traded since November 1989.\n\nAmong its recent corporate developments, Denny’s announced a partnership with REEF, an operator of North American virtual restaurants, logistics and proximity hubs. The companies will work together on new delivery options from virtual kitchens in metropolitan trade areas.\nDenny’s also has a flair for playful publicity: last week, it offered free weddings at its Las Vegas chapel on Valentine's Day, and in December it teamed with AT\u0026T Inc.'s (NYSE: T) Warner Bros. division on a promotion tied to the film “The Matrix: Resurrections” that enabled Denny's Rewards members to be transported into a real-life version of The Matrix to experience personalized \"glitches\" that provided them with free delivery and other randomized prizes in their digital offers wallet.\nIn its most recent earnings report, the fourth-quarter data published Feb. 15, Denny’s recorded $107.6 million in total operating revenue, up 34.4% from $80.1 million in the prior year’s quarter.
