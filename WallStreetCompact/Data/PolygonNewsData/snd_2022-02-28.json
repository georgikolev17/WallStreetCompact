Two of the five new deals announced were potential deals in the works.\nTEGNA Inc. (NYSE: TGNA)\nFounded in 1906 and headquartered in Tysons, Virginia, TEGNA is a digital media and marketing services company. It was created on June 29, 2015, when the Gannett Company split into two publicly traded companies.\nWe first added TEGNA as a potential deal in the works on August 16, 2019, when Apollo Global Management (NYSE: APO) approached the company about a deal. TEGNA’s price after this announcement was $14.28. On January 21, 2020, another large investor in Tegna (NYSE: TGNA) wanted the company to pursue a merger or sale. During March 2020 even as the nation was coming to grips with a new pandemic and the market dropped sharply, Tegna received four competing offers.\nBidding War Timeline\n\nOn March 6, 2020, Gray Television (NYSE: GTN) made an offer to acquire Tegna (NYSE: TGNA) for approximately $8.5 billion in a cash plus stock deal worth $20 per share.\nMedia mogul Byron Allen made a bid for the company on March 11, 2020.\nA week later, on March 17, 2020, the Najafi Companies announced the delivery of an offer to Tegna’s (TGNA) board of directors to jointly acquire the company. Gray Television withdrew its offer the same day.\nThe following day on March 30, 2020, shares of Tegna (NYSE: TGNA) fell the most since November 2008, Apollo Global Management ended its pursuit of the broadcaster, the second suitor to withdraw an offer during the ongoing turmoil in global markets. TGNA’s closing price on March 30 was $10.31.\nOn September 21, 2021, Tegna once again received takeover interest from media mogul Byron Allen and Apollo Global Management. TGNA’s price after this announcement was $21.52.\nOn November 5, 2021, Byron Allen raised $10 billion in preferred equity and debt for his bid for Tegna, hoping to prevail over a rival offer from investment firms Apollo Global Management and Standard General.\nOn February 4, 2022, Tegna announced that it was in advanced discussions with one of its largest shareholders, Standard General, about a potential buyout at about $24 a share.\nOn February 21, 2022, Bloomberg reported that Standard General and Apollo Global Management were nearing a deal to acquire Tegna. TGNA’s price before this announcement was $20.95.\nThe deal was confirmed the next day on February 24, 2022, with Tegna agreeing to be acquired by an affiliate of Standard General for $24.00 per share in cash. The transaction has an enterprise value of approximately $8.6 billion, representing a premium of approximately 39% to TEGNA’s unaffected closing share price on September 14, 2021, the last full trading day prior to media speculation about a potential sale of TEGNA. TEGNA shareholders could also receive additional cash consideration in the form of an unusual “ticking fee”. The details of the “ticking fee” are given in the New Deals section below.\n\nThis was one of the “Deals In The Works” that appeared to have a high probability of closing given the level of interest from multiple parties, the specificity of the details that leaked and the fact that the company also confirmed that it was in advanced discussions.\nYou can find all the active deals listed below in our Merger Arbitrage Tool (MAT) that automatically updates itself during market hours.\nThere were two new deals announced in the Deals in the Works section last week.\nIf you found this article informative and would like to receive it by email every Monday morning before the market opens, click here to subscribe for free.\nSPAC Arbitrage\nThere were three new SPAC IPOs filed and two new SPAC combinations announced last week.

(Nasdaq: IFRX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing anti-inflammatory therapeutics by targeting the complement system, today reported that the Company has received an advice letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) related to its Phase III program with vilobelimab for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). The feedback indicates that the FDA recommends using the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response Score (“HiSCR”) as the primary endpoint in the Phase III trial. The FDA advice was provided nearly three months after the Company’s protocol submission and contrasts with the FDA advice provided to the Company in a Type A meeting held in Q3 2021. In the minutes of that meeting, FDA provided advice on how to implement, name and validate the meaningfulness of the modified HiSCR, a new primary endpoint suggested by the Company, that would measure the reduction of all three types of inflammatory lesions in HS – inflammatory nodules, abscesses and draining tunnels. A reduction in draining tunnels is not captured by the HiSCR. Within the Type A written response, FDA did not recommend the traditional HiSCR as the primary endpoint measure. Following the advice received in the Type A meeting, earlier this year, InflaRx announced the initiation of a Phase III trial, designed to study patients with moderate to severe HS disease suffering from actively draining tunnels.","keywords":["Health"]},{"id":"0B0cIbzLS6-ErvNbw5QlwOjMOhZSQurT1NOetJfa27I","publisher":{"name":"Zacks Investment Research","homepage_url":"https://www.zacks.com/","logo_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/logos/zacks.png","favicon_url":"https://s3.polygon.io/public/assets/news/favicons/zacks.ico"},"title":"Arcimoto, Inc.
