A new Johns Hopkins review study found that the positive effects of just two sessions of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy can last for over one year in most patients with depression.\nThe movement for psychedelics-positive legislation keeps getting stronger. In Hawaii, a Senator committee approved a bill to study the benefits of psilocybin mushrooms.\nPublic companies in the psychedelics space also came up with substantial milestones. Field Trip (NASDAQ: FTRP) posted a 330% increase in year-over-year revenue for Q3, though the company still had over ten times as much net loss as it had revenue, showing the psychedelics space is still a growth sector years ahead of profitability. Cybin (NYSE:CYBN) placed more bets on conquering the hearts of retail investors, announcing a new partnership with famed new-age author Deepak Chopra. Meanwhile, Enveric (NASDAQ: ENVB) announced a new clinical trial that’ll look to apply a proprietary therapy using psilocybin for cancer-related distress.\nMagic Mushroom's Active Compound Could Relieve Depression For Up To One Year, New Study Finds\nA new review study by Johns Hopkins University researchers is shedding light on the long-term effects of psilocybin in the treatment of major depression.\nIn a new study, 58% of participants with major depressive disorder were in remission after one year of doing two sessions with psilocybin.\n“Psilocybin not only produces significant and immediate effects, it also has a long duration, which suggests that it may be a uniquely useful new treatment for depression,” said Roland Griffiths, Ph.D., professor in Neuropsychopharmacology of Consciousness at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

Didn’t learn anything from it, was too excited to see the original cast back together,” he said.\nBenzinga’s Director of Customer Success Ryan Faloona liked a different General Motors commercial. This one featured a reunion of the A.J. and Meadow characters from “The Sopranos.”\nBut, it was a financial-themed commercial that was Faloona’s top pick.\n“Bringing back the Etrade baby was my
